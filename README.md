# Project Title: Note-Taker

![MIT-Tag](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description:

A simple application using Express.js and Node.js to take and save notes.

### -Motivation:

The motivation behind this project was to make a simple way to generate an html page to display multiple team members all in one place

### -Why This Was Built:

I built this project because I wanted to automate the process of making team member cards in html.

### -Problems Solved:

Using Node.js to create a new file, and write the correct contents to it. Using TDD method I set up the parameters for a successful project. Using terminal responses I was able to create new objects using classes and subclasses to give all of the correct attributes.

### -What was Learned:

I learned how to use NPM to install and use a new package called jest to set up and execute tests. Additionally I learned how classes and subclasses relate, and how to use them to effectively create new objects.
