# Project Title: Note-Taker

![MIT-Tag](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

## Description:

A simple application using Express.js and Node.js to take and save notes.

### -Motivation:

The motivation behind this project was to make a simple application that would let you make, save, and delete notes.

### -Why This Was Built:

I built this project because I wanted to automate the process of taking notes on my computer.

### -Problems Solved:

Using Node.js and Express.js I was able to setup a server and get ,post, delete routes to connect the front end to the back end of the application. This allowed the server to show the front end while also saving or delteing notes to the back end.

### -What was Learned:

I learned how to use different types of routes to accomplish different tasks in connecting the front end to the back end of an application.
